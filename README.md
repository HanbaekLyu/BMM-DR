# BMM-DR
Block Majorization-Minimization with Diminishing Radius (BMM-DR) with applications to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC-decomposition (NCPD).

In the NMF problem, the proposed MUR is implemented and compared with the original MU for dense and sparse data.

In the NCPD problem, BMM-DR and MUR are implemented, compared to vanilla BCD (ALS) and MU.
